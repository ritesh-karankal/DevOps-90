# Introduction to the DevOps World

<aside>
    Watched Civo's session on (What is DevOps?), followed resources from Michael Cade's repo, and read Effective DevOps- ch1 (What is DevOps) to get more insights on DevOps.

    The high-level takeaway was - 
    
    (0) DevOps is a combination of the terms development and operations. Representing a collaborative or shared approach to the tasks performed by an organization's application development and IT operations teams.
    (1) The DevOps mindset or culture is about reducing the time between the ideation phase of a product and its release in production to the end-user or whomever it could be an internal team or customer and being able to drop smaller releases more frequently.
    (2) DevOps is about making this process of continuous delivery fast and with minimal errors and bugs so with DevOps improvements get created and delivered to users fast but also those improvements are of high quality and well tested.
    (3) The other key fundamental point is the responsibility of a DevOps engineer to break down silos between the Developers, Operations, and QA. teams in an organization.
    (4) Many people think about devops as specific tools like Docker or Chef, but
    tools alone are not DevOps. What makes tools ‚ÄúDevOps‚Äù is the manner of their use, not
    the fundamental characteristics of the tools themselves.
