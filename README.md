# DevOps-90days

- This repository is inspired by [Michael Cade's 90DaysOfCode](https://github.com/MichaelCade/90DaysOfDevOps) repository.
- Using this repository to document my journey on getting a better foundational knowledge of "DevOps".
- I will start this journey on September 22, 2022, and the idea is to take 90 days.
- The reasons for documenting these days are so that others can take something from it, to help a DevOps beginner find resources to get started, and the most important reason is to track how I'm progressing through this process, share what I'm learning and keep myself accountable. 


I have no set path or tasks for each day but will be referencing [ Saiyam Pathak's Roadmap](https://youtu.be/7l_n97Mt0ko) and [Michael Cade's 90DaysOfCode](https://github.com/MichaelCade/90DaysOfDevOps) repository to make my journey through this. 

Goal - 
    - The goal is to take 90 days, to tackle over 13 areas of "DevOps" to a piece of foundational knowledge and build some projects to get hands-on experience and learn by doing.
    - This will not cover all things "DevOps" but it will cover the areas that I feel will benefit my learning and understanding overall.
